If the state is won, it of course returns a very high or very low heuristic value, based on which player is currently trying to find a move. Similarly, if the opponent is about to make a move winning them the game, the heuristic is very large. This takes into account disjoint sets so that separated pieces can not come together into a win for the opponent. If there are no immediate threats, the heuristic increases exponentially based on how many in a row this player has. Therefore, 1 on its own is much less valuable than 2 in a row which is much less valuable than 3 in a row, etc."

    "> Against a random player, A* wins almost game, and when going second more consistently than AB pruning. The games took 11.35 moves on average, because A* blocks the random player's possible wins, even if it won't take advantage, and gets randomly blocked. Therefore, the bigger the board size, the fewer moves it takes to win, and the less likely it is for a random player to be able to win or draw as it will make mistakes more often.\n",

    "> Against an AB-player, A* wins every game. The games took 5 moves on average, because the AB pruning player only acts against what an AB pruning player would do, not any other kind of player. Also, when no moves are winning, it picks the first option it finds because very losing state has the same utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Against itself, A* ties every game. The games took 42 moves on average, because both A* players block each other's wins every time, and do not have a complex enough heuristic to establish tactics and strategies like base-inverse, claim-even. The smaller the board, the bigger an advantage the first player has because they have tempo. \n",
    " \n",
    "> The A* player seems much better than the AB-player for several reasons. Most importantly, A* runs much faster than AB-pruning because it does not exponentially explore every possible path to make a move. A* uses a heuristic, which runs quickly and as a bonus, can be improved more flexibly. A* also performs better than AB-pruning because AB-pruning only acts optimally against itself. If its opponent deviates from what the min-player would do, the action it chose was likely suboptimal, and is thus open to be exploited by other strategies, such as A*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The A* algorithm could be expanded in the future to implement more complex heuristics. A heuristic that accounts for tactics, zugzswang, base-inverse, and claim-even rules would be difficult to implement but very effective in looking ahead and understanding which threats are relevant, and what can be ignored to get a better position."
